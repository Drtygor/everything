## Overview

This project is a simple web application built with React for the client-side and Express for the server-side. The application has been designed and tested with a variety of testing suites, including component tests in React, end-to-end tests using Cypress, and unit tests for Express.

## Features

Client-side Rendering: The application utilizes React to build a dynamic, user-friendly interface.
RESTful API: The server-side logic uses Express to create API endpoints, which the client interacts with.
Persistent Data Storage: Data persistence is ensured through the use of a database.

## Installation and Setup

To run this project, you will need to install it locally using npm:

$ cd ../project_directory
$ npm install
$ npm start
Testing

This project uses Jest and React Testing Library for unit and component tests, and Cypress for end-to-end tests. To run the tests, use:

$ npm test

For end-to-end tests with Cypress, use:

$ npm run test:e2e

## Future Enhancements
In order to improve the quality of the codebase, I would recommend the following:

Implementing Authentication and Authorization: Security is key in every application. Currently, our application is lacking in this area. By adding Authentication and Authorization, we can ensure that only authenticated and authorized users have access to certain resources.

Adding Global State Management and Query Caching: The use of global state management systems like Redux or Zustand can help manage the state of the application in a more efficient manner. Additionally, query caching (via tools like React Query or SWR) would ensure that the application can run faster and be more efficient by reusing previously fetched data.

Incorporate Frontend error/loading/success patterns and conditional rendering: Good UI practices are essential for a great user experience. We should handle potential errors gracefully, give feedback to the user when data is being loaded, and use conditional rendering to ensure that the UI only shows what the user needs at that time.
